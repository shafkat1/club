# üî¥ ECR NETWORK ISSUE - ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The ECS tasks are failing to pull Docker images from ECR with **`dial tcp 52.217.233.242:443: i/o timeout`** errors.

**Root Cause**: Tasks are attempting to resolve ECR DNS names to **PUBLIC IP addresses** instead of using the **VPC Endpoint private DNS names**.

---

## üîç DETAILED ANALYSIS

### Current Error Pattern
```
CannotPullContainerError: The task cannot pull 
425687053209.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/clubapp-backend:latest 
from the registry...
dial tcp 52.217.233.242:443: i/o timeout
```

### What's Happening

1. **Task requests**: Pull image from `425687053209.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
2. **DNS Resolution**: Task resolves this to **PUBLIC IP** `52.217.233.242`
3. **Routing Problem**: Task tries to reach PUBLIC IP through PRIVATE SUBNET
4. **Result**: Timeout (no internet route available)

### Why It's Failing

The VPC has:
- ‚úÖ ECR VPC Endpoints created (`vpce-05a20d5cae1f47bdc`, `vpce-0e1f4a613a0d129d9`)
- ‚úÖ VPC Endpoints in correct subnets (`subnet-092a57b2e8874db10`, `subnet-02a56a1d839f819ba`)
- ‚úÖ Private DNS ENABLED for both endpoints
- ‚ùå **BUT**: Private DNS is NOT being used

### Root Cause: No Route to ECR Endpoint

The subnets lack routes to direct traffic to the VPC endpoints. Instead, the system falls back to public DNS resolution, which fails because:

1. The subnets don't have internet gateway routes
2. There's no NAT gateway for public IP resolution
3. There's no VPC endpoint routing configured

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX: Enable VPC Endpoint Private DNS Override

AWS has a feature called **"Private Hosted Zone"** that ECS needs to override public DNS resolution.

This is controlled by a **VPC-level setting** that must be enabled for the VPC.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è SOLUTION

### Step 1: Enable VPC-Level Private DNS Support
```bash
aws ec2 modify-vpc-attribute \
  --vpc-id vpc-xxxxxxx \
  --enable-dns-hostnames \
  --region us-east-1
```

### Step 2: Verify ECR Endpoint Private DNS
```bash
aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoints \
  --filters "Name=service-name,Values=com.amazonaws.us-east-1.ecr.api" \
  --query 'VpcEndpoints[0].PrivateDnsNameOptions' \
  --region us-east-1
```

Should show: `PrivateDnsEnabled: true`

### Step 3: Force New Deployment
```bash
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster clubapp-dev-ecs \
  --service clubapp-dev-svc \
  --force-new-deployment \
  --region us-east-1
```

## üìä Current Configuration Status

### ‚úÖ What's Configured Correctly
- ECR API Endpoint: `vpce-05a20d5cae1f47bdc` (available, Private DNS: **True**)
- ECR DKR Endpoint: `vpce-0e1f4a613a0d129d9` (available, Private DNS: **True**)
- CloudWatch Logs Endpoint: `vpce-0ede30404aeafc84f` (available, Private DNS: **True**)
- Security Group: Allows ALL egress traffic to VPC endpoints
- Subnets: Both endpoints configured in correct subnets

### ‚ùå What's NOT Working
- Task DNS resolution resolves to PUBLIC IPs instead of PRIVATE endpoints
- No DNS override for the ECR domain names
- Tasks cannot reach VPC endpoints because they're routing to public IPs

---

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Verify VPC DNS Settings
```bash
aws ec2 describe-vpc-attribute \
  --vpc-id $(aws ec2 describe-subnets --subnet-ids subnet-092a57b2e8874db10 --query 'Subnets[0].VpcId' --output text --region us-east-1) \
  --attribute enableDnsHostnames \
  --region us-east-1
```

### Phase 2: Check Private DNS Name Options
```bash
aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoints \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --filters "Name=vpc-endpoint-id,Values=vpce-05a20d5cae1f47bdc" \
  --query 'VpcEndpoints[0].PrivateDnsNameOptions'
```

### Phase 3: Rebuild Private DNS Entries
The private DNS entries for `*.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` may need to be created or refreshed.

---

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTION

The issue is NOT that VPC endpoints don't exist. The issue is that:

1. **Private DNS Override** for ECR domain names is not active
2. Tasks are performing DNS lookups that resolve to public IPs
3. Public IPs are unreachable from private subnets

**Solution**: Ensure VPC endpoint private DNS names are properly configured to override the default AWS DNS resolution.
