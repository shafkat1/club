2. EAS config must match exact specification
3. Environment variables matter (NODE_VERSION, EXPO_TOKEN)
4. GitHub Actions runner needs proper Node version

### **Solutions Applied**
1. Added all required dev dependencies
2. Validated configuration against EAS spec
3. Used standard ESLint configs instead of custom ones
4. Removed unsupported configuration sections

### **Testing Strategy**
1. Isolated each error
2. Applied targeted fix
3. Committed and re-triggered
4. Learned from each failure
