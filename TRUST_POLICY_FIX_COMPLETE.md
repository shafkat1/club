# ✅ Trust Policy Fix Complete

## Problem
The `github-actions-apprunner` role had an error: **"Failed to update trust policy. Has prohibited field Resource."**

This occurred because a `Resource` field was accidentally added to the trust policy, which is **not allowed** in assume role policies (trust policies).

## Solution Applied
Updated the trust policy to the correct format with no `Resource` field.

## Current Valid Trust Policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::425687053209:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "StringLike": {
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": [
            "repo:shafkat1/test-automation-generator:*",
            "repo:shafkat1/club:*"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Changes
- ✅ **Removed**: Any `Resource` field (prohibited in trust policies)
- ✅ **Kept**: Correct `Principal` and `Condition` fields
- ✅ **Verified**: Policy is now valid JSON and proper trust policy format

## Why This Works
- **Trust policies** control WHO can assume a role (use `Principal`)
- **Regular IAM policies** control WHAT actions are allowed (use `Resource`)
- GitHub OIDC provider can now authenticate and assume this role for deployments

## Next Steps
Your AWS deployment role is now ready for GitHub Actions workflows to use!

## Verification
You can verify this is fixed by checking the AWS IAM console:
1. Go to **IAM > Roles > github-actions-apprunner**
2. Click **Trust relationships** tab
3. You should see the policy WITHOUT any error messages
4. No `Resource` field should be present
