## How to Know If Your NEW Credentials Are Different

The NEW Access Key ID should:
- Start with `AKIA`
- Be COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from `AKIAWGHHM6OM53ZY744B`
- Look something like: `AKIAVFKNSMQXYZ123456` (example)

---

## Then Come Back and Paste

Once you have:
1. ✅ Created NEW credentials (different from old ones)
2. ✅ Copied both the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

Run this command:
```powershell
cd C:\ai4\club
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\update_aws_credentials.ps1
```

Then paste your NEW credentials when prompted.

## If Still Not Working

Check:
1. Are you in the **correct AWS account** (425687053209)?
2. Is the Access Key ID **different** from the old one?
3. Did you copy the **entire** Secret Access Key (no spaces)?
4. Is your user account **IAM Administrator** or has full permissions?

If unsure, create a new IAM user with full permissions and generate credentials for that user.
