## 🔄 **Authentication Flow**

```
Login Page (/login)
   ↓ (Sign In form submitted)
   ↓ (isAuthenticated = true)
   ↓
App Layout (/app) [Protected Route]
   ├─ Sidebar Navigation
   └─ Main Content Area
       ├─ Map Page (default)
       ├─ Discover Page
       ├─ Friends Page
       ├─ Groups Page
       ├─ Offers Page
       ├─ Messages Page
       ├─ Profile Page
       └─ Settings Page

- **Protected Routes**: All `/app/*` routes redirect to `/login` if `!isAuthenticated`
- **Redirect on Success**: Login redirects to `/app/map`
- **Logout**: Clears auth and redirects to `/login`
