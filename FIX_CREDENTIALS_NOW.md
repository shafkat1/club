# FIX YOUR AWS CREDENTIALS NOW

## Problem
‚ùå Current credentials are INVALID:
- Access Key ID: `AKIAWGHHM6OM4NL3RTOM`
- Error: "The security token included in the request is invalid"

This means the secret access key is wrong, or the key pair is corrupted.

---

## Solution: Regenerate Fresh Credentials

### IMPORTANT: Do This Carefully

The credentials MUST match exactly. AWS is very particular about:
- No extra spaces
- Correct case (UPPERCASE/lowercase)
- Full length of secret key
- Correct AWS account (425687053209)

---

## Step 1: Verify You're in the Right Account

1. Go to: **https://console.aws.amazon.com**
2. Look at the **top-right corner** after you log in
3. You should see: **Account ID: 425687053209** or your username

**If you see a different account ID, you're in the wrong account!**

---

## Step 2: Delete ALL Old Access Keys

1. Click your **username** (top-right)
2. Select **Security Credentials**
3. Scroll to **Access keys**
4. Find these old keys and **DELETE ALL OF THEM:**
   - `AKIAWGHHM6OM53ZY744B` (first invalid one)
   - `AKIAWGHHM6OM4NL3RTOM` (second invalid one)
5. Click **Delete** for each one

---

## Step 3: Create a BRAND NEW Access Key

1. Still in **Security Credentials**
2. Click **Create access key**
3. Choose: **Command Line Interface (CLI)** 
4. Accept the security reminder
5. Click **Create access key**

---

## Step 4: IMPORTANT - Copy Correctly

You'll see this screen:
```
Access key ID: AKIA...
Secret access key: ...
```

### Do THIS RIGHT NOW:

1. **Click "Download .csv file"** to save both values
   - OR manually copy each value

2. **Access Key ID:** 
   - Click "Copy" button
   - Paste into a text editor
   - Verify it starts with AKIA and is about 20 characters

3. **Secret Access Key:**
   - Click "Copy" button  
   - Paste into a text editor
   - Verify it's a long string (40+ characters)
   - It includes special characters like: / + 

4. **Do NOT close this page yet!**

## Step 5: Update Your Local Credentials

**Open PowerShell and run:**

```powershell
cd C:\ai4\club
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\update_aws_credentials.ps1
```

**When prompted:**
1. Paste the **NEW Access Key ID** you just copied
2. Paste the **NEW Secret Access Key** you just copied
3. Let it test automatically

**Expected success message:**
```
SUCCESS! AWS credentials are valid:
Account ID: 425687053209
...
```

---

## Step 6: If Still Failing

If it's STILL failing after following these steps exactly:

1. **Double-check in AWS Console:**
   - Is the key you just created showing as "ACTIVE"?
   - Are you in account 425687053209?

2. **Try copying one more time:**
   - Delete the key
   - Create a fresh one
   - Use the CSV download to avoid copy/paste errors

3. **Check your user permissions:**
   - Your user needs: **IAMFullAccess** or **Administrator**
   - If not, ask your AWS account admin to create credentials for you

---

## Step 7: Once Verified Working

Run this to confirm:
```powershell
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

Should show:
```json
{
    "UserId": "AIDAW...",
    "Account": "425687053209",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::425687053209:user/..."
}
```

**Once this works, I'll immediately create the deployment role!** ‚úÖ

## Common Mistakes

‚ùå **Copying with extra spaces**
- Check: No spaces at beginning or end

‚ùå **Using wrong secret key**
- The secret key MUST match the Access Key ID
- They come as a pair

‚ùå **Missing special characters**
- Secret keys have: `/`, `+`, `=` etc.
- Copy the ENTIRE thing

‚ùå **Wrong AWS account**
- Verify Account ID is: **425687053209**

‚ùå **Key is INACTIVE**
- New keys should be ACTIVE immediately
- If not, delete and create again
