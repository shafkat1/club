# Club App Development Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the development progress of the Club App - a map-first drink purchasing platform connecting people at venues.

## Completed âœ…

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- [x] AWS Terraform infrastructure (VPC, RDS, Redis, DynamoDB, S3, ECS, ALB)
- [x] Secrets Manager with auto-rotation
- [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with OIDC
- [x] S3 backend and DynamoDB state locking
- [x] Terraform unlock workflow for stuck locks

### Backend (NestJS)
- [x] Prisma schema with complete data models:
  - Users (phone, email, OAuth)
  - Groups & GroupMembers (friend management)
  - Venues (bars, clubs, pubs)
  - Orders (drink purchases)
  - Redemptions (bartender verification)
  - Presence (real-time tracking)
  - Devices (push notifications)
  - AuditLog (activity tracking)
  
- [x] Core DTOs:
  - Auth DTOs (OTP, social login, tokens)
  - Order DTOs (CRUD operations)
  - Venue DTOs (search, presence)
  
- [x] Authentication Module:
  - Phone OTP via Twilio
  - Social login (Google, Facebook, Instagram, Apple, TikTok, Snapchat, Twitter)
  - JWT token generation & refresh
  - Redis-backed session storage
  - Current user profile endpoint

## In Progress ðŸš€

### Infrastructure
- Terraform deployment (currently applying with `enable_domain=false`)
- Will enable domain/DNS after infrastructure is stable

- [ ] Orders Module (create, list, update, payment integration with Stripe)
- [ ] Redemptions Module (QR code generation, bartender scanning)
- [ ] Presence Module (real-time user tracking, drink interests)
- [ ] Groups Module (friend management, shared venue presence)
- [ ] Payments Module (Stripe integration, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
- [ ] WebSocket/Realtime Module (Ably or Socket.IO for live updates)
- [ ] Push Notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- [ ] API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] E2E Tests

### Mobile (React Native + Expo)
- [ ] Project initialization
- [ ] Authentication screens (phone OTP, social login)
- [ ] Map screen with nearby venues
- [ ] Venue details & presence list
- [ ] Drink buyer flow (select recipient, send drink)
- [ ] Drink receiver flow (accept/reject drinks)
- [ ] Groups & friends management
- [ ] Profile & settings
- [ ] Push notifications integration

### Web Portal (Next.js) - Bartender/Admin
- [ ] Project initialization
- [ ] Bartender authentication
- [ ] QR code scanner
- [ ] Redemption workflow
- [ ] Admin dashboard
