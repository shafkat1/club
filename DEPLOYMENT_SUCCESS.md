## 🔍 Monitor Progress

### Check real-time status:
```bash
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster clubapp-dev-ecs \
  --services clubapp-dev-svc \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --query 'services[0].[status,desiredCount,runningCount]'
```

### Check task logs:
```bash
# Once task is running and logs start appearing
aws logs tail /ecs/clubapp-backend --follow
```

### Check task details:
```bash
aws ecs describe-tasks \
  --cluster clubapp-dev-ecs \
  --tasks arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:425687053209:task/clubapp-dev-ecs/43002d8b490f47259bdce5f07ef7b830 \
