## üìä CURRENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS

### Service Status
```
Cluster: clubapp-dev-ecs
Service: clubapp-dev-svc
Status: ACTIVE
Desired Count: 1
Running Count: Starting...
Pending Count: 1
```

### Task Status
```
Task ARN: arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:425687053209:task/clubapp-dev-ecs/70622065b06e4b8eaca12a81f489cd30
Status: PENDING (Starting up)
Launch Type: FARGATE
Container: web
Container Status: PENDING
```

### Recent Events
```
‚úÖ [12:59:32] Task started successfully
‚è≥ [12:58:50] Previous pull error (now resolved with new CloudWatch setup)
‚úÖ [12:55:36] Earlier task started
‚úÖ [12:53:53] Earlier task started
```

---

## üîç WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW

1. **Task Initialization**: The container is being initialized with Fargate
2. **CloudWatch Streaming**: Log stream created at `/ecs/clubapp-backend/ecs/web/{taskId}`
3. **Application Startup**: NestJS backend starting up (typically takes 10-30 seconds)
4. **Health Check**: ECS will wait for container to stabilize

### Expected Next Steps (5-10 minutes)
1. Container starts running (`lastStatus: RUNNING`)
2. Application logs appear in CloudWatch
3. Health check passes (if configured)
4. Task becomes fully RUNNING
5. Load balancer registers the task
6. Service becomes healthy
